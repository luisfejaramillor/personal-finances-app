# Personal Finance App - WomenWhoCode

This API allows users to manage products by creating, reading, updating, and deleting them. It uses Express.js and Joi for validation.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables.
4. Run the server by running `npm start`.

## Usage

The API has the following endpoints:

### GET /api/v1/products

Get a list of all products.

### POST /api/v1/products

Create a new product.

### PATCH /api/v1/products/:id

Update a product by ID.

### DELETE /api/v1/products/:id

Delete a product by ID.

To create a product, make a `POST` request to `/api/v1/products` with a JSON body containing the following fields:

- `name` (required, string)
- `description` (required, string)
- `price` (required, number)
- `qty` (required, number)
- `category` (required, number)
- `id` (forbidden)

Example JSON body:

```json
{
    "name": "Product name",
    "description": "Product description",
    "price": 10.99,
    "qty": 100,
    "category": "Product category"
}
```

To update a product, make a `PATCH` request to `/api/v1/products/:id` with a JSON body containing the fields you want to update.
